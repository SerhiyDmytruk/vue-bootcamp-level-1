In this challenge you are tasked with creating a star rating input component.

The challenge will require that you work in \`RatingInput.vue\` and refrence \`App.vue\`.

## Requirements

### the Rating Input should:

1. Accept the following props:

   - \`modelValue\` - this represents the rating the user has picked and allows the component to work with v-model
   - \`count\` - this is the total number of stars the rating should display (default is 5)

2. Emit the following events:

   - update:modelValue - emit when a star is clicked on. The payload is the rating (1, 2, 3, etc)
   - You should also validate the event payload to ensure that it is a number

3. Display a button for each star based on the provided count

4. Display solid yellow stars for stars less than or equal to the \`modelValue\`

5. Display outlined gray stars for stars greater than the \`modelValue\`

6. Support the following keyboard shortcuts when the rating wrapper is focused

   - Pressing keyboard numbers 0-9 should set the rating accordingly
   - Pressing the \`ArrowUp\` or \`ArrowRight\` key should increment the rating by 1
   - Pressing the \`ArrowDown\` or \`ArrowLeft\` key should decrement the rating by 1

7. Apply the class \`perfect-rating\` to the \`rating-wrapper\` div when a perfect rating is selected

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: The stars will turn orange when the perfect-rating class is applied to the \`rating-wrapper\`


By the end of the exercise you should have something that looks like this:

## Other Considerations

- If you see the \`data-test\` attribute in the boilerplate don't remove it. If you remove it, your code may be invalid for the certificate.
