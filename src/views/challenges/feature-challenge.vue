# Message Board

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a simple message board system. The challenge will require that you work in \`MessageBoard.vue\` and \`MessageForm.vue\`.

## Requirements

### The MessageBoard component should:

1. Accept the following props

   - \`messages\` - array, required

2. Display a list of the messages

   - Allow the parent component to determine the markup displayed within each list item

3. Transition the list items

   - When a new message is added to the list, it should slide in
   - You should do it with the provided \`slide\` style and a built-in Vue component

   - > ðŸ’¡ HINT: Make sure that the transition is applied to the item element being added
   - > ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can come back to this after you finish the MessageForm below

### The MessageForm component should:

1. Include a form with a single message input and a submit button

2. Emit a \`send-msg\` event whenever the form is submitted (button is clicked or enter is pressed).

   - The payload should be a message object with the following properties:
     - id - a random id
     - author: a random name (can use \`faker.person.firstName()\`)
     - timestamp: the current date/time as a string
     - content: the message provided in the input

3. Disable the form submit button when the message is empty

4. Reset the form after submit

## Other Considerations

- If you see the \`data-test\` attribute in the boilerplate don't remove it. If you remove it, your code may be invalid for the certificate.

- TailwindCSS is preinstalled and with default config. It might be helpful for you if you want to have some styles. Or if you'd like to see a pretty result as you develop, you can use the following semantic classes that have been included: \`send-btn\`, \`input-box\`.
